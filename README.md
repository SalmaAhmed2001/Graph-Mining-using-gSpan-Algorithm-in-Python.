# Graph-Mining-using-gSpan-Algorithm-in-Python.
This project implements the gSpan algorithm for mining frequent subgraphs in a given set of graphs. 

The code includes a parser function for parsing command-line arguments, a main function that performs the gSpan algorithm, and a gs variable that stores the output of the algorithm. The code allows the user to configure the algorithm with various parameters such as support threshold, minimum number of nodes in a subgraph, and debug mode. The gSpan algorithm is a popular algorithm for frequent subgraph mining, and this project provides a Python implementation for users to apply to their own datasets.
